## Hi! I'm Mateo Jacques.

I believe there is still much to explore in the realm of what can be achieved on the web. My goal is to contribute to projects that push those boundaries, offering innovative solutions to modern problems.
Iâ€™m currently working full-time as a Fullstack Web Developer with React, Next.js, Typescript, Node.js, MySQL and MongoDB. I also use React Native and Ruby on Rails on a daily basis, among other tools.

**Languages**: Native in Spanish, proficient in English (C1), basic Japanese (N5).
