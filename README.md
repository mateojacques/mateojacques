## Hi! I'm Mateo Jacques.

I am a self-taught **Front End Web Developer** and **Web Designer** since 2019. I've been coding since I was 13, but by that time I've already had set up quite a few websites.
I have a passion for writing **clean and concise code** that, in conjuction with a good understanding of **web design principles**, allows me to create work that I'm proud of.
I **always** keep learning (and **always** will).
