## Hi! I'm Mateo Jacques.

My name is Mateo Jacques and I am a self-taught **Frontend Web Developer**. I've been coding since I was a kid, but by that time I've already had set up quite a few websites. I have a passion for writing **clean and concise code** that, in conjuction with a **good understanding of web design principles**, allows me to create work that I'm proud of. I **always** keep learning (and **always** will).

I’m currently working as a Fullstack Web Developer, while pursuing a degree in Software Engineering and continuing to study Web Development on my own. I’m very passionate about my craft and I'm currently focused on giving my 100% to improve my quality of work, and to **keep learning** in the process.

**Languages**: Spanish (native), English (advanced).
**Location**: Buenos Aires, Argentina.
